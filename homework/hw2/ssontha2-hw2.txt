\
A) In figure A, the quantitative data of single cell gene expression is visualized on a UMAP subspace. Points are used as the geometric primitive which aggregate that end up becoming geometric primitives of areas that represent groups or clusters of points. Color is the visual channel used to distinguish the protocol used for the assay. The axes refer to the reduced dimensions done through UMAP. The authors are trying to make salient that when we run a joint dimensionality reduction on the data from all protocols, we find that in the lower dimensional space the populations of cells, which are supposed to be composed of the same cell types across protocols, to not group together in two dimensions. Due to this finding, the authors are also using the visual channel of position, as they want to show that the clusters are positioned differently in the shared UMAP space. I think the authors did a good job at displaying their point through this figure, as they are just trying to show that in 2 reduced dimensions the cell types across different protocols do not cluster together. Something that might help is to assign hue\'92s to clusters by their respective cell type so that readers can see where similar cell types across protocols are. For example, for B cells across protocols, we might want to color them by a range of purple hues to denote that they are the same time, but different hues convey different datasets. We did not get to see cell types in this figure and I think that may be helpful. \

B) \
In figure B, we also have points as the geometric primitive which form groups or clusters which is based on quantitative data of single cell gene expression, which lead to geometric primitives of position due to the aggregation of points. Again the visual channel of color is used to denote the protocol used to sequence the cells, but in this figure the purple dataset (3\'92 V1 protocol) is not that visible. Initially when I saw this it seemed like only the green and yellow dataset were included in this figure. The choice of color can be better for the purple dataset. In this figure, which is post dataset integration, the authors are trying to make salient the idea that after integration, similar groups of cells cluster together in 2d UMAP space. This is then using the visual channel of position to encode cell type. The figure does show this, although the purple dataset is hard to see. I would choose a different color for the purple dataset that would make it more visible to readers in this map. Although yes, the point the authors make is clear, where is the purple dataset? A side question I have is whether 2d UMAP space preserves enough information in which we can accurately label cell type based on distances between clusters of similar cell type, which is lower after integration. \

C) The authors are visualizing quantitative aggregated single cell gene expression data here, showing the expression of several marker genes in cell types across datasets/protocols. They are specifically visualizing the percentage of cells in a class expressing a marker gene. The x-axis is the cell types, whereas the y axis denotes the genes chosen as markers. They are using the geometric primitive of points to denote the expression level, but they further use visual channels of size and color to denote the percentage of cells expressing the gene and dataset/protocol the cells came from respectively. \
\
They are trying to show that marker genes are commonly expressed in similar cell types across datasets, trying to drive home the point that the cell types across dataset are actually the same time, further justifying the rationale behind the integration method. An improvement could be to do a statistical test to test whether percentage of cells expressing the markers are of the same distribution across datasets. This would give me more trust that the cells from different protocols are actually the same. I would also question whether marker gene expression is good enough to classify cell type, as their may be translational regulation involved as well. ]\

D) \
\
Here, the authors are using again the geometric primitive of points which become areas once they aggregate in 2d umap space. They use the visual channel of COLOR to denote overall cell type, and HUE to encode finer differences between major cell classes (for example cd8 and cd4 T cells). They also have legends on top of the figure, which makes the figure a little hard to see and interpret. If I was making this figure, I would likely split it into a 3 figure sub panel that highlights the major cell classes independently. I also feel that there are too many colors on the same plot, which is hard to see. They again use position to encode cell type, in that post integration similar cell types cluster together. I think the authors are just trying to show here that similar cell types are positionally similar, and they do a decent job, the only downside is that there are too many colors on the same plot. Again it is quantitative data of single cell gene expression.

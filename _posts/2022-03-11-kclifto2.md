Expression of 28 proteins has been measured in 11512 spleen cells by fluorescence intensity. Each cell area and position in the tissue sample has also been recorded. Fluorescence intensity has been normalized by area and given in counts per thousand units. tSNE was performed on the first ten principle components from PCA on the protein expression matrix to display the data in low dimensional space. Cells were grouped by kmeans clustering on the protein expression data into ten clusters and visualized on the low dimensional embeddings (Figure A). Cells were plotted as they appear positionally in the tissue sample labeled by clusters (Figure B). Cells in the white space seem unique at least regarding placement, so the cluster that contains most of those cells, cluster 10, was chosen for further analysis.  Figure C shows where all cells in cluster 10 are positioned in the splenic tissue sample. Boxplots were created to show differential expression across the ten clusters for all 28 proteins. Figure D showcases a set of boxplots in which protein expression was upregulated in cluster 10 compared to the other clusters. Podoplanin is upregulated in cluster 10 and in the spleen is known to be expressed by perivasculature cells such as macrophages. If cells in cluster 10 are in splenic vasculature, the sample may be a crosssection of a splenic artery.

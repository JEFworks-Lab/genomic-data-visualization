# Lecture 1

## 1.0 Lesson learning objectives

By the end of this lesson, we should be able to establish a common vocabulary for discussing data visualizations. We will also begin programming in R.

## 1.1 Attribution

This lesson is heavily built on “Fundamentals of Data Visualization” by Claus O. Wilke. You can find a free copy of this book on Dr. Wilke's website: [https://clauswilke.com/dataviz](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/index.html) 

## 1.2 What is data visualization? And why do we care?

Data visualization is the graphical representation of data. When done appropriately, a good data visualization can (1) help identify patterns and trends in the data to help people perceive certain information faster or more easily, and (2) help explain these patterns to a wider audience. We will refer to these two goals of data visualization as "exploratory" and "explanatory" objectives.

## 1.3 Gestalt principles

Gestalt principles are an essential part of visual design (generally, not just data visualization). There are more than ten overlapping principles. We will focus a few most applicable to data visualization.

- **Similarity**: Items alike in their properties (size, shape, color, and so on) tend to be perceived as being a related group.
- **Proximity**: Items are near each other tend to be perceived as being a related group.
- **Enclosure**: Items surrounded by something such as a line or an an object tend to be perceived as being a group.
- **Continuity**: Elements tend to be perceived as smooth groups or continuous lines rather than sharp broken lines.

## 1.4 Data types

Different types of data can be visualized in different ways using different visual encodings. There are many types of data:

- **Categorical data** represent qualitative characteristics. Categorical data can take on numerical values, but those numbers don’t have mathematical meaning.
- **Ordinal data** represent mixes numerical and categorical data. The data fall into categories, but the numbers placed on the categories have meaning. 
- **Quantitative data** represent numerical values.  Values can be interpreted mathematically. 
- **Relational data** represent how numerical and categorical data are related
- **Spatial data** represents information about the physical location and shape

## 1.5 Data encodings

Types of encodings for different data types including
- **Geometric primitives** such as points, lines, and areas
- **Visual channels** such as size, color, shape, position, angle, and texture

## 1.6 Salience

Salience (in data visualization) is how the viewer's eye is drawn to what is important in the data visualization. A good data visualization enhances saliency e.g. improves viewer understanding of the data.

Different data encodings for different data types offer differing levels of salience.

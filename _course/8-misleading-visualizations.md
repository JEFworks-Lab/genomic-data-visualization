# Lecture 8

## 8.0 Lesson learning objectives

By the end of this lesson, we should better understand how analyses and data design principals may be used to mislead (often unintentionally) and how we can use data visualization to correct our misunderstanding.

# Hands-on component 8

We will perform an analysis using the data analysis approaches we have learned so far and use data visualizations with the intention of misleading. Then we will use data visualization to correct our misunderstanding.

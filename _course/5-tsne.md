---

# Lecture 5

## 5.0 Lesson learning objectives

By the end of this lesson, we should understand what is t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and how to apply it to our spatial transcriptomic datasets.

# Hands-on component 5

Our in-class hands-on component will analyzing either the MERFISH or Visium dataset to create a data visualization using tSNE. We will also critique a data visualization together and do an in-class demonstration of the homework submission process.

# Class Lesson Notes 5

Notes from class will be uploaded here.

# Homework Assignment 5

You will be assigned to a data visualization made by one of your classmates. Write a critique using vocabulary terms from Lesson 1. Make a pull request to submit your homework (due Monday).

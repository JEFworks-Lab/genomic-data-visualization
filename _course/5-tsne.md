# Lecture 5

## 5.0 Lesson learning objectives

By the end of this lesson, we should understand what is t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and how to apply it to our spatial transcriptomic datasets.

# Hands-on component 5

Our in-class hands-on component will analyzing either the MERFISH or Visium dataset to create a data visualization using tSNE. We will also critique a data visualization together and do an in-class demonstration of the homework submission process.

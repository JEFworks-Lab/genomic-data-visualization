# Lecture 3

## 3.0 Lesson learning objectives

By the end of this lesson, we should understand sources of quality variability in spatially resolved transcriptomics data, how to evaluate the quality of spatially resolved transcriptomic data and use data visualizations to assist us in this assessment. 

## 3.1 Why summarize?

## 3.1.1 Types of summary statistics

- Sum (total)
- Mean (average)
- Spread (variance)
- Dependence (pairwise correlations)

## 3.2 Quality Control 

- Total number of genes per cell
- Unique number of gene species per cell
- Total number of cells expressing a gene

## 3.3 Normalizing

# Hands-on component 3

Our in-class hands-on component will involve analyzing either the MERFISH or Visium dataset to create a data visualization to evaluate the data quality. We will also do an in-class demonstration of the homework submission process.

# Class Lesson Notes 3

Notes from class will be uploaded here.

# Homework 3

Make a new data visualization of either the MERFISH or Visium dataset using ggplot in R (do not make the same visualizations that were made in class). Write a description of what you did using vocabulary terms from Lesson 1. Make a pull request to submit your homework (due Thursday).

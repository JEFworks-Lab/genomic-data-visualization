description: I am a first-year ScM student from the Biostatistics Department at Bloomberg working in Prof. Hongkai Ji's and Prof. Jie Xiao's lab. I'm doing projects in single-cell genomics and wish to learn more about data processing in genomics. My goal is to apply computational tools and mathematical, statistical models to understand 3D/4D genome structures.
